This is an applescript that allows you to select a single movie and have it quickly remuxed (not converted) to MP4
this is great if you run a plex server, as you dont need to transcode MP$'s so there is less stress on the server.

Key points:
You need to have FFMPEG installed - see below
Its much faster than coverting the file in handbrake
The sound and video quality of the original file is maintained
As its remuxed (not converted) the resulting file size will be similar to the original file.
It places the original file in the trash


Installing ffmpeg
1 First install brew (https://brew.sh) by typing this into the terminal without quotes "/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
